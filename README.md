# Personal CV Website

This project contains the files for a personal CV website, designed to be hosted for free using GitHub Pages.

## How to Deploy

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub.**
2.  **Upload all the files from this project** (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `CV_Sravani_HVenkata_.pdf`, and the screenshot images) to your new repository.
3.  **Go to your repository's settings.**
4.  **Navigate to the "Pages" section** in the left-hand menu.
5.  **Under "Branch", select your main branch** (usually `main` or `master`) and leave the folder as `/ (root)`.
6.  **Click "Save".**
7.  **Wait a few minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy your site. You will see the URL for your live site in the same section.

## How to Customize

*   **`index.html`**: Open this file to edit your personal information, skills, project details, and experience.
*   **`styles.css`**: You can change the colors and fonts here to personalize the look of your site.
*   **Images**: To update your course certificates, you can either replace the existing screenshot files or upload new ones and update the filenames in `index.html`.
